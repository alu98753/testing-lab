      # Reminder: Coverage Comparison Logic
      # HW4 requires the job to fail if coverage is lower than the previous.
      # This step is complex to implement natively in Actions without third-party tools
      # or significant custom scripting to download, parse, and compare lcov.info files.
      # Consider tools like Codecov or implement a script to fetch the artifact from
      # the main branch's last successful run, parse lcov.info, and compare.
      # For now, ensure tests pass and reports are uploaded.
